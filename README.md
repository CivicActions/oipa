# CivicActions Open Innoviation Practice Area - DRAFT

CivicActions is building off the GitHub's Open Source Project Office (OSPO) framework to build out an Open Innovation Practice Area (OIPA) for our team. 

We want to build onto and contribute back to the work of OSPOs and build on their policies, tools, and best practices. We also want to leverage our 20 years of experience as an open source first company, to help frame the next 20 years of innovation. We thank folks like [TODO](https://todogroup.org/) & [OSPO Alliance](https://ospo.zone/), [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/) and [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/) for their extensive contributions to this space. We will be building out CivicTech tools and content that we can leverage with our digital government clients.

### GitHub Actions

In addition to the information in this repository, we've also released a number of GitHub Actions that can help OSPOs track activity, clean house, and automate other useful activities. The actions are released in separate repos but are all linked here for convenience.

- [github/contributors](https://github.com/github/contributors) - Given an organization or repository, produces information about the contributors over the specified time period.
- [github/evergreen](https://github.com/github/evergreen) - Enable automated security updates and open a issue/PR in repos in an org that have dependency files but no dependabot.yaml file
- [github/issue-metrics](https://github.com/github/issue-metrics) - Gather metrics on issues/prs/discussions such as time to first response, count of issues opened, closed, etc.
- [github/stale-repos](https://github.com/github/stale-repos) - Identify and report on repositories with no activity for configurable amount of time, in order to surface inactive repos to be considered for archival
- [github/cleanowners](https://github.com/github/cleanowners) - A GitHub Action to suggest removal of non-organization members from CODEOWNERS files
- [github/automatic-contrib-prs](https://github.com/github/automatic-contrib-prs) - Automatically open a pull request for repositories that have no CONTRIBUTING.md file

### GitHub Apps

- [github-community-projects/internal-contribution-forks](https://github.com/github-community-projects/internal-contribution-forks) - A GitHub App that allows you to contribute upstream using a "private fork"
